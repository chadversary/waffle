Waffle 1.4.0-rc1 (2014-09-06)
=============================

Waffle 1.4.0-rc1 is now available. This is a pre-release for 1.4.0.

As usual, the release is available as a tarball...

...and as a signed 'v1.4.0-rc1' tag in git:

You can track the release in Waffle's snazzy new Github tracker:

It's been a loooooong time since the last release (Waffle 1.3.0 happened in
2013!) and a lot has happened since then. Waffle now has a wflinfo utility,
supports Linux DRM render nodes through the GBM backend, is packaged by several
distributions, and has a proper issue tracker on Github.  The most prominent
change, in my opinion, as that Waffle has more active contributors than last
year (namely Jordan and Emil).

Since I've been out of practice of making releases, the release candidate will
cautiously bake for a full week before the final release.  If all goes
smoothly, I plan to upload the final 1.4.0 tarballs on Monday 15 September.

The next major release (2.0) will likely happen later this month.  Emil has
been working hard to add Windows support to Waffle and Piglit, and that needs
to be packaged up and shipped soon.


Backwards compatibility notes
-----------------------------
Waffle 1.4.0 preserves ABI and API backwards-compatibility with Waffle 1.3.0.


New Features
------------
* All platforms

    * wflinfo

      The new 'wflinfo' utility reports information about the system's OpenGL
      capabilities, similar to 'glxinfo'.  See the documentation at
      [man:wflinfo.1] or [http://www.waffle-gl.org/man/wflinfo.1.html].

* Linux

    * GBM backend now supports DRM render nodes.

      Waffle's GBM backend will use render nodes (/dev/dri/render*) if
      available, and otherwise fallback to a DRI card device (/dev/dri/card*).

    * Debian packaging support

      Waffle now has Debian packaging support.  If you're using Debian, it
      should be available in the unstable sid release in in packages with names
      starting with 'libwaffle' and in the 'waffle-utils' package.
