Waffle 1.4.0 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Backwards compatibility notes
-----------------------------
Waffle 1.4.0 is backwards-compatible with Waffle 1.3.0, in ABI and API.


New Features
------------
* All platforms

    * wflinfo

      The new 'wflinfo' utility reports information about the system's OpenGL
      capabilities, similar to 'glxinfo'.  See the documentation at
      [man:wflinfo.1] or [http://www.waffle-gl.org/man/wflinfo.1.html].

      (Implemented by Jordan Justen. Chad Versace fixed some bugs and corner
      cases).

* Linux

    * GBM backend gains support for DRM render nodes.

      Waffle's GBM backend will now use render nodes (/dev/dri/render*) if
      available. Otherwise, it falls back to 1.3.0 behavior and will use a DRI
      card device (/dev/dri/card*). Render nodes require a recent kernel; you
      may need to add drm.rnodes=1 to the kernel cmdline.

      (Implemented by Jordan Justen).

    * Debian packaging support.

      Waffle now contains a toplevel 'debian' directory that supports creation
      of Debian packages.  Waffle packages are already available in Debian
      Unstable ("sid") as 'libwaffle-1.0', 'libwaffle-dev', 'libwaffle-doc',
      and 'waffle-utils'.

      (Debian packages are maintained by Jordan Justen).
